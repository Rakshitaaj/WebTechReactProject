            <p>Trippy LLC was founded by Stephen Kaufer, Langley Steinert, Nick Shanny, and Thomas Palka in February 2000. Kaufer came up with the idea after being frustrated planning a family vacation.


Headquarters, Needham, Massachusetts
In September 2000, before the website was launched, the company obtained $2 million in financing. Seed money was obtained from Flagship Ventures, the Bollard Group, and private investors.

In 2004, the company was acquired by IAC/InterActiveCorp. In August 2005, IAC spun off its travel group of businesses under the Expedia, Inc. name.
